# 1. Purpose

## Mission

This Constitution establishes the foundational engineering principles, governance model, quality standards, architectural constraints, and decision-making framework for the development and long-term evolution of this project.

The project aims to build a modern Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform for managing tourism operations, including products, quotations, reservations, customers, and related business processes.

While the business domain may evolve over time, every implementation must preserve the architectural principles defined in this Constitution.

---

## Project Context

The platform is designed following a Specification-Driven Development approach, where documentation is considered the primary source of truth for the system.

Development is assisted by Artificial Intelligence tools such as Spec Kit and Claude Code. Therefore, specifications must be explicit, deterministic, and consistent to ensure predictable implementation.

The product is expected to evolve from a single-customer MVP into a scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform without requiring fundamental architectural redesign.

---

## Technology Direction

The project adopts a technology stack chosen to maximize development speed, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

At the time this Constitution is published, the official technology direction is:

Frontend

- Angular
- TypeScript
- Standalone Components
- Angular Signals
- Reactive Forms

Backend

- Supabase
- PostgreSQL
- Authentication
- Storage
- Row Level Security

Content Management

- WordPress (Headless CMS)

Infrastructure

- Docker-compatible deployment
- Cloud-first architecture
- Infrastructure portability

Future technology changes are permitted only if they preserve the architectural principles established by this Constitution.

---

## Scope

This Constitution governs every engineering activity performed within the project, including:

- Product planning
- Functional specifications
- Domain modeling
- Technical architecture
- Database design
- Infrastructure
- Source code
- Automated testing

---

## Authority

This Constitution is the highest-level engineering specification of the project.

All lower-level documents—including the Product Requirements Document (PRD), Domain Model, Use Cases, Technical Architecture, Cross-Cutting Requirements, Development Standards, implementation plans, and source code—shall comply with the principles established herein.

If any contradiction exists, this Constitution takes precedence until formally amended.

---

## Stability

This document is intended to remain stable throughout the project's lifetime.

Business requirements, implementation details, and technologies may evolve.

The engineering principles established by this Constitution should evolve only through deliberate architectural governance.

Frequent modifications to this document indicate architectural instability and should be avoided.

---

## Intended Audience

This Constitution is written for:

- Product Owners
- Software Architects
- Software Engineers
- QA Engineers
- DevOps Engineers
- Technical Reviewers
- AI Development Agents
- Future Contributors

Every participant involved in the project is expected to understand and follow the principles defined in this document.

---

## Guiding Statement

The purpose of this Constitution is to ensure that the project evolves through disciplined engineering rather than accumulated complexity.

Every decision should contribute to building a platform that is simple to understand, reliable to operate, maintainable to evolve, and capable of supporting long-term business growth.

# 2. Product Engineering Philosophy

## Philosophy Statement

The project shall be developed following a product engineering mindset rather than a feature delivery mindset.

The objective is not to maximize the number of implemented features, but to maximize long-term product quality, business value, maintainability, and engineering consistency.

Every technical decision shall contribute to building a platform capable of evolving predictably over time.

---

# Engineering Values

When engineering decisions involve trade-offs, the following values shall be applied in descending order of priority.

## 1. Business Value First

Technology exists to solve business problems.

No architectural pattern, framework, optimization or abstraction shall be introduced unless it provides measurable business value or significantly improves maintainability.

Engineering serves the product—not the other way around.

---

## 2. Simplicity Over Complexity

The preferred solution is the simplest one that correctly solves the current business problem.

Complexity must always be justified.

Future possibilities alone are not sufficient justification for increasing present complexity.

Whenever two solutions provide equivalent business value, the simpler solution shall be chosen.

---

## 3. Convention Over Configuration

The platform should rely on well-defined engineering conventions instead of excessive configurability.

Standardized folder structures, naming conventions, architectural patterns and implementation strategies shall be preferred over project-specific variations.

Consistency across the codebase is considered more valuable than individual flexibility.

---

## 4. Evolution Over Prediction

The architecture shall evolve incrementally.

The project must avoid designing for hypothetical future requirements.

Features should become more sophisticated only when real business needs justify the additional complexity.

Premature optimization is discouraged.

---

## 5. Consistency Over Innovation

New technologies, architectural patterns and implementation approaches should only be introduced when they provide clear and measurable advantages.

Maintaining a coherent engineering ecosystem is preferred over adopting fashionable technologies.

Innovation is encouraged only when it improves the product without compromising maintainability.

---

## 6. Explicitness Over Implicit Behavior

Engineering decisions should be visible, understandable and traceable.

The project should avoid hidden behavior, implicit conventions, magic values and undocumented assumptions.

Code should communicate intent clearly.

Specifications should remove ambiguity whenever possible.

---

## 7. Documentation Before Implementation

Documentation is part of the product.

Specifications define expected behavior before implementation begins.

Engineering documentation shall evolve together with the system and remain synchronized with the implementation.

Source code does not replace documentation.

---

## 8. Composition Over Duplication

Existing components, services and business rules should be reused whenever appropriate.

New implementations should compose existing capabilities before creating parallel solutions.

Duplicated business logic is prohibited.

---

## 9. Security By Design

Security shall be treated as a fundamental architectural concern rather than a post-development activity.

Authentication, authorization, auditing, data protection and tenant isolation must be considered from the earliest design stages.

Security requirements shall influence architecture, not merely implementation.

---

## 10. AI-Assisted Engineering

Artificial Intelligence is considered an engineering accelerator, not an architectural authority.

AI-generated solutions must follow project specifications, architectural standards and documented conventions.

AI may improve implementation quality, but it shall not redefine product architecture.

---

# Decision Hierarchy

When two engineering principles conflict, decisions shall follow the following order of precedence.

1. Business Value
2. Security
3. Simplicity
4. Maintainability
5. Consistency
6. Performance
7. Developer Convenience

Lower-priority values shall never compromise higher-priority ones without explicit architectural approval.

---

# Engineering Mindset

Every contributor is expected to think as a product engineer rather than simply a software developer.

Before implementing any solution, contributors should ask:

- Does this solve a real business problem?
- Is this the simplest acceptable solution?
- Will another developer understand this in one year?
- Does this preserve architectural consistency?
- Does this increase unnecessary complexity?
- Can this solution evolve without major rewrites?

If any answer raises significant concerns, implementation should be reconsidered before development continues.

---

# Guiding Principle

The project values disciplined engineering over rapid feature accumulation.

A smaller, coherent, and maintainable platform is always preferred over a larger system whose complexity exceeds its business value.

# 3. Governance

## Purpose

The governance model defines how engineering decisions are created, documented, approved, implemented, and maintained throughout the project's lifecycle.

Its objective is to preserve architectural integrity, prevent knowledge fragmentation, and ensure that every implementation remains aligned with the project's long-term vision.

Governance exists to protect consistency rather than restrict innovation.

---

# Governance Principles

The project shall be governed according to the following principles.

## Documentation First

Specifications define the system.

Source code implements the specifications.

Documentation always precedes implementation.

No implementation shall become the primary source of truth.

---

## Explicit Decisions

Every significant engineering decision must be documented.

Architectural decisions should never exist only in source code or conversations.

Engineering knowledge must remain discoverable.

---

## Traceable Evolution

Every significant change must be traceable from its origin to its implementation.

The project must always be able to answer:

- Why was this decision made?
- Who approved it?
- Which specification introduced it?
- Which implementation fulfills it?

---

## Controlled Evolution

Architecture shall evolve intentionally.

Large architectural changes should occur through documented proposals rather than incremental undocumented modifications.

---

# Governance Hierarchy

Project knowledge is organized into hierarchical specifications.

Each document owns a specific responsibility.

Silently introducing architectural changes is prohibited.

---

# Guiding Principle

Governance exists to ensure that the project grows through deliberate engineering decisions rather than through accumulated implementation details.

The architecture should become more coherent over time, never more accidental.

# 4. Quality Attributes

## Purpose

Quality attributes define the non-functional characteristics that every part of the platform must satisfy.

Unlike functional requirements, quality attributes apply across the entire system and influence every architectural and implementation decision.

Whenever multiple implementation alternatives exist, the option that best satisfies these quality attributes shall be preferred.

---

# Quality Attribute Hierarchy

The project prioritizes quality attributes in the following order.

1. Correctness
2. Security
3. Maintainability
4. Simplicity
5. Reliability
6. Consistency
7. Scalability
8. Performance
9. Extensibility
10. Usability

Lower-priority attributes shall never compromise higher-priority ones without explicit architectural approval.

---

# Correctness

## Principle

The system shall always behave according to its documented specifications.

Correct behavior is more important than fast delivery.

Business rules must be deterministic, testable and reproducible.

## Requirements

The platform SHALL:

- Produce deterministic results.
- Validate all business rules.
- Reject invalid operations.
- Preserve data integrity.
- Prevent inconsistent states.

---

# Security

## Principle

Security is a quality attribute rather than a feature.

Every architectural decision shall consider authentication, authorization, data protection and auditability.

## Requirements

The platform SHALL:

- Authenticate every protected operation.
- Authorize every business action.
- Protect sensitive information.
- Isolate tenant data.
- Record critical events.

---

# Maintainability

## Principle

The platform is expected to evolve continuously.

Code should be optimized for understanding rather than cleverness.

Future developers should require minimal effort to understand existing functionality.

## Requirements

The platform SHALL:

- Encourage modular design.
- Minimize coupling.
- Maximize cohesion.
- Prefer readable implementations.
- Keep business logic isolated.

---

# Simplicity

## Principle

Every solution should minimize unnecessary complexity.

Complexity is considered a maintenance cost.

New abstractions require clear justification.

## Requirements

The platform SHALL:

- Prefer straightforward implementations.
- Avoid premature abstractions.
- Eliminate duplicated solutions.
- Reduce unnecessary configuration.
- Favor convention over customization.

---

# Reliability

## Principle

Users should be able to trust the platform.

Unexpected failures should never compromise data integrity.

## Requirements

The platform SHALL:

- Handle failures gracefully.
- Preserve transactional consistency.
- Recover safely whenever possible.
- Avoid silent failures.
- Surface meaningful error information.

---

# Consistency

## Principle

The product should behave predictably across every module.

Consistency reduces cognitive load for both users and developers.

## Requirements

The platform SHALL:

- Reuse established patterns.
- Maintain consistent naming.
- Preserve UI conventions.
- Standardize business workflows.
- Apply identical engineering standards across modules.

---

# Scalability

## Principle

Architecture should enable growth without requiring redesign.

Scalability should emerge naturally from modular design.

## Requirements

The platform SHALL:

- Support incremental expansion.
- Remain compatible with multi-tenancy.
- Isolate business capabilities.
- Minimize architectural bottlenecks.
- Avoid unnecessary coupling.

---

# Performance

## Principle

Performance should satisfy business expectations while preserving maintainability.

Optimization must be driven by evidence rather than assumptions.

## Requirements

The platform SHOULD:

- Minimize unnecessary network requests.
- Avoid duplicated database queries.
- Use caching where appropriate.
- Optimize expensive operations.
- Measure before optimizing.

---

# Extensibility

## Principle

Future capabilities should integrate with existing architecture rather than replace it.

New functionality should require minimal modifications to existing modules.

## Requirements

The platform SHOULD:

- Encourage composition.
- Preserve module boundaries.
- Avoid rigid dependencies.
- Support gradual expansion.

---

# Usability

## Principle

The platform should remain intuitive for operators, administrators and business users.

Complex internal logic should never become visible to end users.

## Requirements

The platform SHOULD:

- Minimize user effort.
- Reduce repetitive actions.
- Provide meaningful feedback.
- Keep workflows intuitive.
- Prioritize operational efficiency.

---

# Quality Validation

Every major architectural decision should be evaluated against these quality attributes.

If an implementation significantly degrades a higher-priority attribute, the decision shall be reconsidered before approval.

Quality attributes are considered long-term architectural commitments rather than implementation goals.

---

# Guiding Principle

The platform shall be judged not only by the features it provides, but by the quality with which those features are designed, implemented and maintained.

High-quality engineering is the foundation that enables sustainable product evolution.

# 5. Architecture Principles

## Purpose

This chapter defines the permanent architectural principles that govern how the platform is designed, structured, and evolved.

These principles are technology-aware but technology-independent whenever possible. They describe *how* the system should be built rather than *what* technologies implement it.

Every architectural decision SHALL comply with these principles.

---

# Architectural Vision

The platform SHALL be developed as a **modular, specification-driven, AI-assisted SaaS application**.

The architecture SHALL prioritize:

- Business clarity over technical sophistication.
- Modularity over monolithic business logic.
- Evolution over prediction.
- Consistency over customization.
- Simplicity over unnecessary abstraction.

Architecture SHALL evolve incrementally while preserving long-term maintainability.

---

# Architectural Style

The MVP SHALL adopt a **Modular Monolith** architecture.

Business capabilities SHALL be isolated into independent modules that communicate through well-defined interfaces.

A distributed architecture (microservices, event buses, multiple deployable services) SHALL NOT be introduced unless justified by measurable business requirements.

The preferred evolution path is:

Single Application

↓

Modular Monolith

↓

Modular SaaS

↓

Distributed Services (only if required)

Premature distribution is prohibited.

---

# Business Capability Organization

The application SHALL be organized around business capabilities rather than technical layers.

Examples of business capabilities include:

- Identity & Access
- Customers
- Products
- Reservations
- Quotations
- Reports
- Content
- Administration

Each capability SHALL own:

- Its business rules
- Its data access
- Its services
- Its UI
- Its validation rules

Business capabilities SHOULD minimize dependencies on one another.

---

# Separation of Concerns

The architecture SHALL clearly separate:

- Presentation
- Application
- Domain
- Infrastructure

Each layer SHALL have a single responsibility.

Business logic SHALL never depend directly on infrastructure implementations.

Infrastructure SHALL support the domain, never define it.

---

# Domain-Centric Design

The business domain is the heart of the platform.

Technology SHALL adapt to the domain.

The domain SHALL NEVER adapt to technological limitations unless explicitly approved.

Business terminology SHALL remain consistent across:

- Specifications
- Database
- API
- Source code
- User interface

A single ubiquitous language SHALL be maintained throughout the project.

---

# Composition Over Inheritance

Composition SHALL be the preferred mechanism for code reuse.

Inheritance SHALL only be used when it models a true "is-a" relationship.

Deep inheritance hierarchies SHOULD be avoided.

Reusable services SHOULD remain loosely coupled.

---

# Convention Over Configuration

The platform SHALL prefer conventions whenever possible.

Developers SHOULD not have to decide how every feature is organized.

Folder structures, naming, module organization, testing strategy, and architectural patterns SHALL follow documented conventions.

Reducing unnecessary decisions improves consistency.

---

# Explicit Dependencies

Dependencies between modules SHALL remain visible and intentional.

Hidden dependencies are prohibited.

Circular dependencies are prohibited.

Every dependency SHALL exist for a documented reason.

---

# Stateless Business Services

Business services SHOULD remain stateless whenever practical.

State SHALL belong to the database, authenticated session, or explicit application state.

Business behavior SHALL remain deterministic.

---

# API-First Mindset

Whenever communication exists between architectural boundaries, contracts SHALL be defined before implementation.

Interfaces SHOULD be stable.

Breaking API changes SHALL require specification updates.

---

# Multi-Tenant Readiness

The architecture SHALL remain compatible with future multi-tenant evolution.

Tenant isolation SHALL be considered in:

- Database design
- Authorization
- Business rules
- Auditing
- Reporting

The MVP SHALL avoid decisions that make future tenant isolation difficult.

---

# Infrastructure Independence

Business rules SHALL remain independent from deployment infrastructure.

The domain SHOULD remain portable.

Replacing hosting providers or deployment strategies SHOULD require minimal changes to business logic.

---

# Managed Services Philosophy

Whenever appropriate, the project SHOULD prefer mature managed services over custom-built infrastructure.

The objective is to reduce operational complexity while preserving architectural control.

Managed services SHALL remain replaceable through clearly defined boundaries.

---

# Evolution Strategy

Architecture SHALL evolve through small, reversible improvements.

Large architectural rewrites SHOULD be considered a failure of incremental evolution.

Continuous refinement is preferred over disruptive redesign.

---

# Architectural Integrity

Every new module SHALL answer the following questions before implementation:

- Which business capability owns this functionality?
- Does it introduce unnecessary coupling?
- Can it evolve independently?
- Does it duplicate existing behavior?
- Does it respect the ubiquitous language?
- Does it preserve modularity?
- Does it increase cognitive complexity?

If any answer raises concern, the design SHALL be reconsidered.

---

# Guiding Principle

The architecture exists to support the business—not to showcase technical sophistication.

A modular system with clear boundaries, predictable behavior, and disciplined evolution is always preferred over a technically impressive architecture that exceeds the needs of the product.

# 6. Domain Modeling Principles

## Purpose

The domain model is the conceptual representation of the business.

It defines the language, concepts, rules, and relationships that describe how the business operates, independently of any technology or implementation detail.

The purpose of these principles is to ensure that the domain remains expressive, consistent, maintainable, and capable of evolving as business knowledge grows.

The domain SHALL always represent the business—not the software.

---

# Domain Philosophy

The project adopts a pragmatic Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach.

The objective is not to implement every DDD pattern, but to preserve the principles that create the greatest business value.

The domain SHALL remain:

- Simple
- Expressive
- Consistent
- Technology independent
- Easy to evolve

Business understanding always has priority over architectural sophistication.

---

# Ubiquitous Language

A single ubiquitous language SHALL exist throughout the project.

Every business concept SHALL use exactly the same terminology in:

- Constitution
- PRD
- Domain Model
- Use Cases
- Architecture
- Database
- Source Code
- APIs
- User Interface
- Documentation

The same business concept SHALL NEVER receive different names.

Likewise, different concepts SHALL NEVER share the same name.

The ubiquitous language is considered part of the architecture.

---

# Business Before Technology

Technology SHALL implement business concepts.

Business concepts SHALL NOT emerge from technological limitations.

Frameworks, databases, APIs, libraries and infrastructure are implementation details.

The business vocabulary SHALL remain independent from them.

Technology-specific terminology SHALL NOT appear inside the domain model.

---

# Domain Concept Hierarchy

Business concepts SHALL be modeled according to the following hierarchy.

1. Entities
2. Value Objects
3. Aggregates
4. Domain Services
5. Domain Events
6. Repositories (Architectural)
7. Application Services (Outside the Domain)

Each concept has a distinct responsibility.

Mixing responsibilities between concepts SHALL be avoided.

---

# Entities

Entities represent business objects with identity.

Entities SHALL:

- Own a unique identity.
- Protect business invariants.
- Encapsulate behavior.
- Represent long-lived business concepts.

Identity SHALL be immutable.

Attributes MAY change.

Identity SHALL NOT.

---

# Value Objects

Value Objects describe characteristics.

They SHALL:

- Have no independent identity.
- Be immutable whenever practical.
- Be compared by value.
- Remain side-effect free.

Value Objects SHOULD simplify business rules.

---

# Aggregates

Aggregates define transactional consistency boundaries.

Every Aggregate SHALL:

- Protect its invariants.
- Expose a clear public interface.
- Prevent inconsistent modifications.
- Own the lifecycle of internal objects.

Large aggregates SHOULD be avoided.

Aggregates SHALL communicate through identifiers rather than object references whenever practical.

---

# Domain Services

Business operations that naturally span multiple entities MAY be implemented as Domain Services.

Domain Services SHALL:

- Represent business capabilities.
- Remain stateless.
- Avoid infrastructure dependencies.
- Preserve business terminology.

---

# Domain Events

Important business events SHOULD be modeled explicitly.

Examples include:

- Reservation Requested
- Reservation Confirmed
- Payment Registered

Domain Events SHALL describe facts that already occurred.

They SHALL NOT represent commands or technical notifications.

---

# Business Rules

Business rules belong to the domain.

They SHALL NOT be duplicated across:

- UI
- APIs
- Database
- Infrastructure
- Reports

Every rule SHALL have a single authoritative implementation.

---

# Invariants

Every entity SHALL preserve its own invariants.

Invalid business states SHALL never be persisted.

Business consistency SHALL always take precedence over implementation convenience.

---

# State Transitions

Entities SHALL evolve through explicit state transitions.

Each transition SHALL:

- Validate business rules.
- Preserve invariants.
- Produce predictable results.
- Reject invalid operations.

State transitions SHOULD remain deterministic.

---

# Bounded Contexts

The system SHALL be divided into explicit business capabilities.

Each capability owns:

- Vocabulary
- Business rules
- Data
- Processes

Cross-context dependencies SHALL be minimized.

Shared business concepts SHALL remain consistent.

---

# Identity Principles

Identifiers SHALL:

- Represent identity only.
- Never encode business meaning.
- Remain immutable.
- Be globally unique whenever practical.

Changing an identifier SHALL be considered creating a different entity.

---

# Auditability

Significant business changes SHOULD be auditable.

The purpose of auditing is to explain business evolution rather than technical execution.

Business events SHOULD remain understandable by non-technical stakeholders.

---

# Domain Evolution Rules

The domain SHALL evolve through documented business knowledge rather than implementation convenience.

No new business concept SHALL be introduced directly into the source code.

Every new concept SHALL first appear in:

1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. Domain Model
3. Use Cases (if applicable)
4. Technical Architecture (if required)

Only after the documentation has been updated MAY implementation begin.

Business concepts SHALL NEVER originate from implementation.

Obsolete concepts SHALL be removed rather than silently abandoned.

The domain SHALL continuously converge toward greater clarity.

---

# AI Collaboration

AI assistants SHALL preserve the integrity of the domain.

Before proposing any modification, AI SHALL determine:

- Does this concept already exist?
- Does another entity already solve this problem?
- Does the proposal duplicate business terminology?
- Does the proposal preserve the ubiquitous language?
- Does the proposal introduce unnecessary complexity?

AI SHALL NOT:

- invent entities without business justification;
- rename business concepts without updating specifications;
- duplicate domain logic;
- bypass documented business rules;
- create parallel domain models.

When uncertainty exists, AI SHALL request clarification rather than making assumptions.

---

# Guiding Principle

The domain is the heart of the platform.

Technology, infrastructure, frameworks, and source code exist only to faithfully implement the business model.

A clear and coherent domain is the strongest predictor of a maintainable and evolvable software system.

# 7. Engineering Standards

## Purpose

Engineering standards define the permanent principles that govern how software is designed, implemented, reviewed, and maintained throughout the project.

These standards establish a common engineering culture focused on quality, consistency, and long-term maintainability.

Implementation conventions (such as folder structures, naming conventions, formatting rules, or Git workflows) are intentionally documented in the **Development Standards** specification and are therefore outside the scope of this Constitution.

---

# Engineering Philosophy

Engineering is the disciplined practice of transforming business knowledge into reliable software.

Every implementation SHALL prioritize:

- Correctness
- Simplicity
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Consistency

Fast delivery SHALL NEVER justify poor engineering practices.

---

# Readability First

Source code is written primarily for humans.

Every implementation SHALL communicate intent clearly.

Code SHOULD minimize the need for external explanation.

Readable code is considered more valuable than clever code.

---

# Self-Documenting Code

Whenever practical, code SHALL explain itself through:

- Meaningful names
- Clear structure
- Small responsibilities
- Explicit behavior

Comments SHOULD explain **why**, not **what**.

Comments that duplicate code SHALL be avoided.

---

# Simplicity

Solutions SHALL remain as simple as possible while satisfying business requirements.

Complexity is considered technical debt unless justified by measurable business value.

Developers SHOULD remove unnecessary complexity whenever it is discovered.

---

# Single Responsibility

Every software component SHALL have one primary responsibility.

Responsibilities SHOULD remain cohesive and clearly identifiable.

Components that accumulate unrelated responsibilities SHOULD be refactored.

---

# Modularity

Modules SHALL remain independent.

Communication between modules SHOULD occur through explicit interfaces.

Internal implementation details SHALL remain private.

Dependencies SHALL be intentional and minimal.

---

# Reuse Before Creation

Before introducing new components, contributors SHALL determine whether an existing solution already satisfies the requirement.

Business logic SHALL NOT be duplicated.

Reusable solutions SHALL be preferred over parallel implementations.

---

# Error Handling

Errors are part of normal system behavior.

Every operation SHALL:

- Validate its inputs.
- Detect exceptional conditions.
- Fail predictably.
- Produce meaningful feedback.
- Preserve system consistency.

Silent failures are prohibited.

---

# Defensive Engineering

The system SHALL assume that invalid inputs, unexpected states, and integration failures are possible.

Software SHOULD fail safely rather than unpredictably.

Critical business operations SHALL protect data integrity under failure conditions.

---

# Technical Debt

Technical debt SHALL be treated as a managed engineering decision.

Intentional technical debt MUST:

- Be documented.
- Include justification.
- Define associated risks.
- Include a planned resolution strategy.

Undocumented technical debt is prohibited.

---

# Refactoring

Refactoring is considered part of normal software development.

Contributors SHOULD improve existing code whenever:

- Readability increases.
- Duplication decreases.
- Complexity decreases.
- Maintainability improves.

Refactoring SHALL preserve externally observable behavior unless explicitly approved.

---

# Dependency Management

Every dependency introduces long-term maintenance costs.

Before adding a dependency, contributors SHALL evaluate:

- Business necessity.
- Community maturity.
- Maintenance activity.
- Security implications.
- Functional overlap.
- Long-term sustainability.

Introducing dependencies for convenience alone SHOULD be avoided.

---

# Code Reviews

Every significant implementation SHOULD undergo technical review.

The purpose of review is to improve the software rather than evaluate individuals.

Reviews SHOULD focus on:

- Business correctness.
- Architectural consistency.
- Simplicity.
- Maintainability.
- Security.
- Testability.

Personal coding preferences SHALL NOT override documented engineering principles.

---

# Continuous Improvement

Engineering standards SHALL evolve through experience.

When recurring problems are identified, contributors SHOULD improve the engineering process rather than repeatedly solving the same problem.

The project values learning over perfection.

---

# AI-Assisted Engineering

AI-generated code SHALL be evaluated using exactly the same engineering standards as human-written code.

Artificial Intelligence SHALL NOT be considered an authoritative source.

Every AI-generated contribution SHALL be reviewed for:

- Correctness
- Architectural consistency
- Security
- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Compliance with project specifications

Acceptance SHALL depend on quality—not authorship.

---

# Engineering Ethics

Every contributor is responsible for protecting the long-term health of the platform.

Short-term productivity SHALL NEVER compromise:

- Data integrity
- Security
- Business correctness

Engineering decisions SHOULD benefit future contributors as much as current ones.

---

# Guiding Principle

Engineering excellence is achieved through disciplined consistency rather than individual brilliance.

A predictable, understandable, and maintainable codebase will always outperform a complex system built around isolated technical expertise.

# 8. Security Principles

## Purpose

Security is a foundational quality attribute of the platform.

It is not considered a feature, an optional enhancement, or a post-development activity.

Every architectural decision, implementation, and operational process SHALL preserve the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability of the platform and its data.

Security SHALL be designed into the system from the beginning.

---

# Security Philosophy

The project adopts a **Security by Design** approach.

Security controls SHALL be incorporated during specification, architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

Security SHALL favor prevention over detection.

The platform SHALL assume that failures, attacks, misuse, and human error are inevitable.

Therefore, the architecture SHALL minimize the impact of those events rather than assuming they will never occur.

---

# Security Objectives

The platform SHALL protect:

- Users
- Organizations
- Business data
- Personal information
- Authentication credentials
- Sessions
- Audit information
- Business operations

Protection SHALL apply regardless of deployment model or infrastructure provider.

- Input validation
- Audit logging
- Infrastructure security

---

## Secure by Default

Default configurations SHALL prioritize security rather than convenience.

Unsafe behavior SHALL require explicit configuration.

---

## Trust Nothing

Every external request SHALL be considered untrusted until validated.

Inputs, tokens, sessions, APIs, integrations, and uploaded content SHALL all be treated as potentially malicious.

---

# Identity and Authentication

Authentication SHALL uniquely identify every user.

Identity SHALL remain independent from authorization.

Authentication mechanisms SHALL support future evolution without requiring business logic changes.

Credential management SHALL rely on trusted identity providers whenever practical.

---

# Authorization

Authorization SHALL be evaluated for every protected business operation.

Permissions SHALL be enforced consistently across:

- User Interface
- APIs

- Data classification
- Auditability
- Sharing policies

SHALL be documented and reviewed before implementation.

---

# Guiding Principle

Data is one of the platform's most valuable assets.

Its value depends not on the quantity collected, but on its accuracy, integrity, security, privacy, and ability to support trustworthy business decisions over time.
# 10. Multi-Tenant Readiness

## Purpose

The platform SHALL be designed with multi-tenant readiness as a core architectural principle.

Although the initial MVP may serve a single organization, architectural decisions SHALL preserve the ability to evolve into a multi-tenant SaaS platform without requiring fundamental redesign.

Multi-tenancy SHALL be considered an architectural capability rather than a feature.

---

# Multi-Tenant Philosophy

The platform SHALL be tenant-aware.

Every business operation SHALL execute within the context of a single tenant.

Tenant context SHALL influence authentication, authorization, business rules, data ownership, auditing, reporting, configuration, and integrations.

No component SHALL assume that only one organization exists.

---

# Tenant Identity

Every organization SHALL possess a unique and stable identity.

Tenant identity SHALL:

- Represent organizational ownership.
- Remain immutable.
- Be independent of business names.
- Be propagated consistently across the platform.

Business data SHALL always belong to exactly one tenant unless explicitly designed otherwise.

---

# Data Isolation

Tenant information SHALL remain logically isolated.

The platform SHALL ensure that:

- Data cannot be accessed across tenant boundaries.

# 12. Observability & Operational Excellence

## Purpose

Observability enables the platform to understand, measure, and improve its behavior in production.

Operational Excellence ensures that the system can be operated, maintained, diagnosed, and evolved with confidence throughout its lifecycle.

The objective is not to collect data, but to enable informed operational decisions based on trustworthy information.

---

# Operational Philosophy

The platform SHALL be designed to make its behavior understandable.

Operational visibility SHALL be considered part of the product rather than an infrastructure concern.

Every critical business capability SHOULD provide enough operational information to explain:

- What happened.
- When it happened.
- Why it happened.
- Who initiated it.
- Which tenant was affected.
- What the outcome was.

Unknown system behavior SHALL be treated as an engineering defect.

---

# Observability Principles

Observability SHALL support understanding rather than data accumulation.

Information collected by the platform SHALL enable contributors to:

- Diagnose failures.
- Understand business activity.

- Tracing.
- Incident response.

SHOULD be documented whenever they significantly affect platform operations.

Major operational changes MAY require an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

---

# Guiding Principle

A platform cannot be effectively operated if its behavior cannot be understood.

Operational excellence is achieved when the system continuously explains itself through meaningful, trustworthy, and actionable information.
# 13. Verification & Quality Assurance

## Purpose

Verification ensures that every artifact produced throughout the project conforms to the specifications, architectural principles, engineering standards, and quality expectations established by this Constitution.

Quality Assurance is a continuous engineering discipline that spans the entire software lifecycle.

Verification SHALL confirm that the right product has been built correctly—not merely that tests pass.

---

# Verification Philosophy

Verification begins with specifications, not with source code.

Every implementation SHALL be traceable to documented business requirements.

The objective of verification is to increase confidence while reducing uncertainty.

Testing is one verification activity, but it is not the only one.

---

# Verification Hierarchy

Verification SHALL occur at multiple levels.

1. Constitution compliance
2. Specification validation
3. Domain validation
4. Architecture validation
5. Implementation review
6. Automated testing
7. Manual verification

- add dependencies without justification.

When uncertainty exists, AI SHALL preserve the approved technology strategy.

---

# Technology Evolution

Technology changes SHALL be intentional.

Replacing major technologies requires evaluation of:

- Business impact
- Migration complexity
- Long-term maintenance
- Operational cost
- Architectural consequences

Major technology replacements SHOULD be documented using an Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

---

# Experimental Technologies

Experimental technologies MAY be evaluated in isolated prototypes.

Experimental code SHALL NOT become part of the production platform until formally approved.

Prototype success SHALL NOT automatically justify adoption.

---

# Portability

The platform SHALL preserve the ability to migrate infrastructure when justified.

Business logic, domain concepts, and specifications SHALL remain independent from deployment providers whenever practical.

Vendor-specific optimizations SHALL be isolated behind clear architectural boundaries.

---

# Governance

The approved technology strategy SHALL be reviewed periodically.

Technology SHALL evolve only when the expected long-term benefits clearly outweigh migration costs and architectural risks.

Consistency SHALL always take precedence over technological novelty.

---

# Guiding Principle

The strength of the platform comes from disciplined engineering and architectural consistency—not from the number of technologies it uses.

A coherent, well-understood technology stack will always outperform an ecosystem of competing tools and unnecessary complexity.
# 15. Definition of Done

## Purpose

The Definition of Done (DoD) establishes the minimum quality standard that every deliverable SHALL satisfy before being considered complete.

A feature is considered **Done** only when it satisfies business, architectural, engineering, operational, and quality expectations.

Partial completion SHALL NOT be represented as complete.

---

# Definition of Done Philosophy

- Is this aligned with the Constitution?

If the answer is "No", the work is not Done.

---

# Completion Rule

A feature SHALL only be considered complete when all applicable Quality Gates have been satisfied.

Meeting only technical requirements SHALL NOT constitute completion.

Evidence of completion SHOULD be available whenever requested.

---

# AI Definition of Done

Before declaring any task complete, AI assistants SHALL verify that every applicable Quality Gate has been satisfied.

AI SHALL explicitly identify any unmet gate.

AI SHALL never represent partially completed work as finished.

When uncertainty exists, the implementation SHALL remain **In Progress**.

---

# Governance

The Definition of Done SHALL evolve as the engineering maturity of the platform increases.

New quality gates MAY be introduced.

Existing gates SHALL only be removed through formal constitutional amendment.

---

# Guiding Principle

Software is not Done when it works.

Software is Done when it demonstrably satisfies the business, architecture, engineering, security, quality, operational, and governance standards defined by this Constitution.

The Definition of Done is the project's ultimate commitment to sustainable engineering excellence.
# 16. Constitutional Governance & Amendment Process

## Purpose

This chapter defines how this Constitution is interpreted, governed, maintained, and evolved.

The Constitution is the highest engineering authority within the project.

Its purpose is to ensure that architectural decisions, engineering practices, and project evolution remain consistent over time while allowing controlled adaptation to new business and technical realities.

---

# Constitutional Authority

This Constitution SHALL serve as the primary engineering governance document for the project.

All project artifacts SHALL remain consistent with its principles, including:

- Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Specifications
- Architecture documents
- Domain models
- Development standards
- ADRs
- Source code
- AI-generated contributions

When conflicts arise, the Constitution SHALL take precedence.

---

# Document Hierarchy

The governance hierarchy SHALL be:

1. Constitution
2. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
3. Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
4. Technical Specifications
5. Development Standards
6. Source Code
7. Operational Documentation

Lower-level artifacts SHALL NOT contradict higher-level artifacts.

Where conflicts exist, they SHALL be resolved by updating the appropriate document rather than bypassing the hierarchy.

---

# Constitutional Interpretation

The Constitution defines principles rather than implementation details.

Interpretation SHALL preserve:

- Business objectives
- Engineering philosophy
- Architectural consistency
- Long-term maintainability

When uncertainty exists, the interpretation requiring the least architectural compromise SHALL be preferred.

---

# Decision-Making Principles

Engineering decisions SHALL prioritize, in order:

1. Business correctness
2. Constitutional compliance
3. Architectural integrity
4. Security
5. Maintainability
6. Simplicity
7. Performance optimization
8. Developer convenience

Short-term productivity SHALL NOT override higher-order principles.

---

# Amendment Principles

The Constitution is intended to be stable.

Amendments SHALL occur only when they:

- Improve clarity.
- Improve consistency.
- Address recurring problems.
- Reflect permanent architectural evolution.
- Better support long-term product strategy.

Temporary implementation needs SHALL NOT justify constitutional changes.

---

# Amendment Process

Every amendment SHOULD include:

- Motivation.
- Current limitation.
- Proposed modification.
- Expected benefits.
- Potential risks.
- Impacted chapters.

Major amendments SHOULD be reviewed before adoption.

---

# Backward Compatibility

Constitutional changes SHOULD preserve compatibility with existing principles whenever practical.

Breaking changes SHALL require explicit justification.

Existing project artifacts SHALL be updated to remain aligned after approved amendments.

---

# Governance Responsibilities

The project owner is responsible for maintaining the integrity of this Constitution.

All contributors share responsibility for identifying inconsistencies, outdated guidance, and opportunities for improvement.

Engineering governance is a shared responsibility.

---

# AI Responsibilities

AI assistants SHALL treat this Constitution as the authoritative source of engineering guidance.

AI SHALL:

- prioritize constitutional compliance;
- identify conflicts between artifacts;
- recommend updates when inconsistencies are detected;
- avoid contradicting established principles.

AI SHALL NOT silently ignore constitutional requirements.

---

# Conflict Resolution

When two project artifacts conflict:

1. Identify the conflicting documents.
2. Determine their position in the governance hierarchy.
3. Apply the higher-authority document.
4. Propose updates to restore consistency.
5. Document significant governance decisions when appropriate.

Conflicts SHALL be resolved through documentation rather than implementation workarounds.

---

# Periodic Review

The Constitution SHOULD be reviewed periodically to ensure that it continues to reflect:

- Business strategy.
- Engineering maturity.
- Architectural evolution.
- Operational experience.

Reviews SHOULD prioritize stability over unnecessary change.

---

# Evolution Philosophy

The Constitution is intended to evolve slowly.

Frequent constitutional changes indicate weaknesses in engineering governance or insufficient architectural planning.

The preferred approach is to improve lower-level documentation before modifying constitutional principles.

---

# Guiding Principle

A stable Constitution creates a stable engineering culture.

The platform SHALL evolve through disciplined governance, intentional architectural decisions, and continuous learning rather than ad hoc implementation choices.

The Constitution exists to protect the long-term integrity of the product while enabling sustainable innovation.
